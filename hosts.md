# A brief history of hosts

This is my personal record of hostnames, because as I get older I realize I'm
remembering these less and less.

## Pre-2010 (Childhood)

* **Colossus** (2006-2011): The oldest hostname I remember, and the name of the
  laptop I got for my 13th birthday. I believe I used other hostnames for
  earlier computers (like my Dad's old laptop I took when he got a new one) but
  I don't remember them. This computer was briefly named _Titanic_ as well, but
  I chose not to keep that name. Named so because it was huge and heavy and had
  a giant battery brick. It got replaced once by Dell due to issues, but the new
  laptop was also named Colossus. Both of them dual booted Windows and Gentoo
  Linux because younger Dylan was insane. I eventually replaced Gentoo with
  Ubuntu because Ubuntu did a better job of recognizing all my hardware.

## 2010-2014 (College Era)

I believe Colossus came with me to college, but honestly I'm not sure if the
computer still had that hostname at the time, since it was a second replacement
of the original. If I gave it a different hostname I do not remember it.

* **Andromeda** (2011-2014; revived 2014-current): The desktop I built in 2011,
  and my first desktop (I paid for components with money from my first tech
  industry job, interning for Bank of America). I think the name choice was
  arbitrary and partially because I was into space. It ran Windows but had two
  (count em) VM's on it:
  * **Wildfire**: The main VM I used, running Arch Linux. The name is a
    reference to Michael Crichton's book _The Andromeda Strain_, in which the
    project that was developed to investigate the Andromeda Strain is named
    Wildfire.
  * **Cassiopia**: A secondary Linux VM running Ubuntu that I mostly used to
    test things that were meant to run on the primarily Debian cluster of Linux
    machines ACM had (that I was an admin for at the time). Named because in
    Greek myth, Cassiopia is Andromeda's mother (nevermind the fact that the
    host/guest relationship should probably imply that goes the other way).
* **Mercury** (2012-2016): My first Mac, it was a 2012 MacBook Air that I bought
  to replace the Dell laptop probably still named Colossus. I deliberated for a
  _long_ time about whether to get a MacBook or a ThinkPad (and hence, whether
  to make Mac or Linux my primary OS), and ACMers were at about a 50/50 split at
  the time (these days I'd imagine it's closer to 80/20 with the majority Mac).
  I'd continue to use ACM Linux workstations, but this marked the beginning of
  the end of my days primarily coding in Linux. Named Mercury because it was
  incredibly light (at the time, at least) and fast (again, at the time), like
  the Roman god.

## 2014-Present (Adulting Era)

Most of my jobs provided me laptops, and I just did things on those and used my
desktop when I was at home, so Mercury slowly gathered dust while I failed to
upgrade to a new personal laptop. The only work laptop listed here is my Two
Chairs laptop which I fully managed and could name, but which died quickly.

* **Valyria** (2014-current): Shortly after starting my first real job, I wanted
  a new project.  Andromeda was in need of upgrades, so I decided to just build
  a full brand new computer. Unlike Andromeda (which was basically just the best
  components I could cheaply afford, and cost me under 1K to put together), I
  put this one together with a visual "red and black" theme. It's named Valyria
  after the original home of House Targaryen (and Blackfyre) in the Song of Ice
  and Fire/Game of Thrones series.
* **Mediatron** (2014-current): Not its actual name, but a better choice. Need
  to pull it out and find the real name, but if I use it again, I might just
  rename it (this is cheating though, because I had not read Diamond Age when I
  set this up). I took some components from Andromeda, bought a new case and
  motherboard (to fit into the new case), and turned it into a media PC for
  serving things. To be honest, it hasn't seen that much use; it was a cool
  project idea but without a good graphics card (the original wouldn't fit) it
  can't do much other than stream movies and the like, and I got a Chromecast
  for that.
* **Caldera** (2017-current): My "burner laptop" for DEFCON, it's a sub-$100
  netbook I picked up in Prime Day. It runs like crap and only has 32GB of
  storage but it's perfect with a super lightweight Linux installation on it and
  it can be cleared out immediately following DEFCON. I've happily used it two
  years in a row now. It's named after the geological formation that occurs when
  an underground magma reservoir sinks a valley (look up the one in Yellowstone,
  it's the subject of a made for TV movie that I watched when I was a kid and
  which introduced me to the concept), because the laptop is regularly reimaged
  and rebirthed in fire, and I liked the sound of "caldera" more than "phoenix"
  (and I love TV on the Radio).
* **Piaget** (April 2018-August 2018): My shortest lived laptop, technically not
  even mine, but since Two Chairs had no tech team except for me, exclusively
  set up and administered by me. Named Piaget because Piaget was the father of
  developmental psychology and I was a software developer at a therapy company
  (maybe it's a stretch, but I personally loved this choice). I'm including this
  here 90% because I like the name I picked for it, even though it was fully
  reimaged and returned to Two Chairs a few months later.
* **Tymora** (2018-current): After leaving Two Chairs, I realized I wanted a
  real personal laptop. Having both a work and personal laptop always seemed
  like too much, but I needed a laptop which was safe to experiment with and I
  wanted the freedom of being able to be briefly unemployed without lacking a
  real development environemnt. Though I'd previously used VMs on my desktop for
  this purpose, I found myself more and more drawn to working on laptops, and
  hence, I bought a new state-of-the-art MacBook Pro (this was a definite "treat
  yourself" moment). Tymora is the goddess of luck in the Forgotten Realms (D&D)
  universe. I picked this name for myriad reasons; on the JMT my crew gave me
  "Lucky" as a trail name, Tymora favors those who take risks and try new
  things, and I liked the general adventuring association a D&D related name
  gave the laptop.
